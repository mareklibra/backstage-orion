# [Backstage](https://backstage.io)

This is your newly scaffolded Backstage App, Good Luck!

To start the app, run:

```sh
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Local development

For local development set the `PARODOS_AUTH_KEY` environment variable to 'Basic dGVzdDp0ZXN0'. This token is base64 encoded string containing `test:test`. You can also use `PARODOS_AUTH_KEY="Basic dGVzdDp0ZXN0" yarn dev` to start development environment with the test token. You can also create an `app-config.local.yaml` file with the following content to automatically include the token.

```yaml
proxy:
  '/parodos':
    headers:
      Authorization: 'Basic dGVzdDp0ZXN0'
```
